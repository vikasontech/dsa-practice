'''
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers index1 and index2, each incremented by one, as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

Solution: 
we are going to use two pointers for this problem, l, r, the left would be in the 0 index, and the r would be in the last index.
if l + r > target means that sum of 2 points is more so to reduce it reduce the r pointer to -1, and conversely if sum is more than the target value,
then add 1 to the left index untill the l > r, or l + r = target value.
